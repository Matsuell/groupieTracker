We Have used Golang for Back-end (data traitment) , and HTML & CSS for front-end (design, etc)

</br>


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here we created a website that retrieves data from an api in golang then we displayed them on a web page using html css and javascript.


### Features available

<ul>
  <li>Get Datas</li>
  <li>Search-bar</li>
  <li>Suggestions on the search bar</li>
  <li>Filters (number of members, date of creation, date of first album,and by locations of concerts)</li>
  <li>Map for display locations of concerts</li>
</ul>


You can search for what you want instead of looking at each of the artists and seeing the data you want 

You can write a word and use the suggestions for write fast.

You can filter the data to see all the artists in the desired places, also according to the number of members in the group, but also by date of creation and by date of first album
